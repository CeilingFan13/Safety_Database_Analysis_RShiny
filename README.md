# Safety_Database_Analysis_RShiny
### Author: Shuang Fan

## 1.	Project Description and Early-Stage Goals
Safety assessment for the drug development life cycle requires complex decision-making and analysis. Adverse event (AE) and serious adverse event (SAE) data are recorded on CRF, and MedDRA dictionary is used to specify system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT). The CTCAE toxicity grade is used to detail the severity of each event.
This project aims to develop a web application utilizing R shiny to transform reported AE/SAE data into interactive visual presentation for safety review. The minimum viable product focuses on UI framework development, flexible data point input (excel format), and treatment group level summary tables/graphs. Subject-level AE tracking, statistical significance testing (see Section 2), and any other applicable components will be included in the subsequent development. Lastly, it would be a long-term goal to integrate decision trees according to FDAâ€™s Final Rule for expediated reporting in category A, B, and C SAEs.
